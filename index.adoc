== Abstract

The UN Open GIS Initiative is catalyzing the development of an open community for basemap vector tile providers. The Initiative promotes the UN Vector Tile Toolkit, a package of open source tools designed to enable public basemap providers, such as the United Nations geospatial information services or governmental mapping organizations, among others, to deliver their basemap vector tiles leveraging the latest web map technologies. The toolkit provides a set of Node.js open source scripts designed for developers to use in conjunction with existing and proven open-source vector tile software (such as https://github.com/mapbox/tippecanoe[Tippecanoe], https://github.com/maputnik/editor[Maputnik], https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js[Mapbox GL JS] and https://github.com/ibesora/vt-optimizer[vt-optimizer]). The toolkit will help organizations to produce, host, style, and optimize fast and interoperable basemap vector tiles, making them available with various application frameworks. 

This paper presents the methodology followed to support the requirements from the UN Peacekeeping operationsâ€™ point of view. The significant challenges were to ensure (1) flexibility of the software so that it works with different source data, including UN mission-specific basemap data and global OpenStreetMap data, (2) automatic and continuous update of global basemap vector tiles, (3) fast vector tiles that can be used with mobile devices in the field, and (4) interoperability with existing enterprise geospatial software frameworks. 

We approached these challenges by introducing "on-the-fly vector tile schema modification" to the Toolkit so that an agile adaptation, improvement, and optimization of the vector tile schema is possible. This method also reduces the use of temporary storage and improves the processing time by exploiting the outstanding stream processing capabilities of Node.js and Tippecanoe. We also adopted an approach to produce basemap vector tiles in modules, so that the processes to produce and deploy the vector tiles are well pipelined. This modularization approach also extended the scalability of the Toolkit by allowing parallel or even distributed production. Quantitative measurements, like in vt-optimizer, were other dominant methodology adopted in the Toolkit that enabled evidence-based performance tuning and production time reduction the vector tiles. As a result, we successfully implemented automatic and continuous updates of basemap vector tiles from a continuously updated PostGIS database. The paper also covers how the project ensured interoperability with different existing enterprise geospatial software frameworks that use less-advanced web map libraries.

The project aims to build a sustainable community of developers supporting the provision of fast and interoperable basemap vector tiles that meet the requirements of various users in the field missions and UN headquarters among others.

== Executive Summary

=== Purpose
The purpose of the UN Vector Tile Toolkit is to mainstream the use of vector tiles in public organizations.

=== Goals
- Provision of methods for automatic and continuous update of basemap vector tiles
- Sustainable developer community to maintain and extend the UN Vector Tile Toolkit

== Background

=== Vector tile technology in dominant platforms and then in Open Source

Dominant web map platforms have adopted **vector tile technology** as early as 2010, although their technology was not always Open Source.

With the advent of OpenStreetMap in 2004, Open Source implementation of the web map technology was hugely accelerated. 

In 2014, https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec[Mapbox Vector Tile Specification] and https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js[Mapbox GL JS] was released.

The License of the Mapbox Vector Tile Specification is as the following:

=== Public organizations to catch up

Most public organizations has not adopted **vector tile technology**. However, clients of web maps from a public organizations tend to compare the web maps of the public organization with the ones from the **dominant web map platforms**.

The UN Vector Tile Toolkit is a project aimed for public organizations to catch up with the vector tile technology of **dominant web map platforms**.

== Considerations
If public organizations catch up with the **vector tile technology** of dominant web map platforms, it will benefit not only the clients of the web maps of the public organizations. In addition, it will also benefit **dominant web platforms** by converging the technology. 

In order for the UN Vector Tile Toolit - a project in a cost-neutral manner - to sustain, the project needs to carefully align itself with the Open Source culture. 

In comparison with collaboration on data, collaboration on software is easier among public organizations that deal with geospatial information. 

We can also leverege the convening power of the United Nations to bring together the relevant actors in the technological development in **basemap vector tiles**. 

== Project definition and major challenges

=== Project definition
To facilitate users with flexible tools to produce vector tiles from various data sources required, to host them, to style them, and to optimize them. 

The main target users are public organizations that have role to provide basemap vector tiles, no matter publicly or for internal use. 

=== Major challenges

==== Flexible software

Existing Open Source projects often depends on specifics of the OpenStreetMap data. In the UN Vector Tile Toolkit, we tried to add some more flexibilities. 

==== Automatic and continuous update

==== Mobile ready

==== Interoperability with existing enterprise geospatial frameworks

== Future possibilities

=== More distributed deployment
- Because the vector tiles are stored in a **mbtiles module farm**, it is easy to distribute to more advanced locations.
